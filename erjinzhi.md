The Open-Falcon can be divided into two parts: mapping component and alarm component. These two parts can work independently.

* Installation of mapping component is to manage collecting, gathering, storing, archiving, sampling, querying and displaying of data (Dashboard/Screen). It can work independently as a storage presentation solution of time-series data.
* Installation of alarm component is to manage alarm policy configuration (portal), alarm judge (judge), alarm handling (alarm/sender), user group management (uic), etc. It can work independently.
* If you are proficient in docker and want to quickly set up and experience Open-Falcon, please refer to Install Open-Falcon with Docker Mirror.
