Refer to Environment preparation

Meanwhile, please check out current work directory setting again:
```
export HOME=/home/work
export WORKSPACE=$HOME/open-falcon
mkdir -p $WORKSPACE
```

##Install Transfer

Transfer’ s default monitoring is at the :8433 port. Agent will push data via jsonrpc.
```
cd $WORKSPACE/transfer/
mv cfg.example.json cfg.json
# by default (all components are in the same server), remain cfg.json unchanged # cfg.json setting items, refer to: https://github.com/open-falcon/transfer/blob/master/README.md# if necessary, appropriately modify cfg.json
# start transfer
./control start
# validation service, provided that service enabled http monitoring port of 6060. if result is ok, it indicated that service has been normally started.
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:6060/health"
#check log
./control tail
# stop transfer
./control stop
```

##Install Agent

Agent need to be deployed on every host. Agent will automatically collect pre-defined items every 60 seconds and push them to transfer.
```
cd $WORKSPACE/agent/
mv cfg.example.json cfg.json

vim cfg.json
- change configuration item ‘enabled’ of transfer to true, showing that it is able to send data to transfer
- change configuration item ‘addr’ of transfer to: ["127.0.0.1:8433"] (change address to monitoring address of transfer component, in the form of a list, configurable as address of multi transfer instances, separating the addresses with commas)
# by default (all components are in the same server), remain cfg.json unchanged # cfg.json setting items, refer to: https://github.com/open-falcon/agent/blob/master/README.md
# start
./control start
# check log
./control tail
```

##Install Graph
Graph is a component for storing mapping data and historic data. Transfer will transmit received data to graph.
```
cd $WORKSPACE/graph/
mv cfg.example.json cfg.json
# by default (all components are in the same server), remain cfg.json unchanged # cfg.json setting items, refer to: https://github.com/open-falcon/graph/blob/master/README.md
# start
./control start
# check log
./control tail
# validation service, provided that service enabled http monitoring port of 6071. if result is ok, it indicated that service has been normally started.
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:6071/health"
```

##Install Query
Query component is query interface to mapping data. When query component receives users’ requests, it will query related data from many back graphs. After data is consolidated, the component will return them to users.
```
cd $WORKSPACE/query/
mv cfg.example.json cfg.json
# by default (all components are in the same server), remain cfg.json unchanged # cfg.json setting items, refer to: https://github.com/open-falcon/query/blob/master/README.md
# start
./control start
# check log
./control tail
```

##Install Dashboard
Dashboard is a user-oriented query interface. Right here users can view all data that is pushed to graph, and check out trending chart.

**Install dependency**
```
yum install -y python-virtualenv mysql-devel  # run as root
cd $WORKSPACE/dashboard/
virtualenv ./env

./env/bin/pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
```

**Configuration**
```
# config path: $WORKSPACE/dashboard/rrd/config.py, including database related configuration information. If necessary, please change it. by default (all components are in the same server), just keep default configuration# database table structure initialization, see the previous Environment Ready section
```

**Start**
```
./control start
--> goto http://127.0.0.1:8081
```
**Check log**
